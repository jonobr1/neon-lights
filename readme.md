# Under Neon Lights

Issues:
+ iOS occasionally renders wrong camera or maybe it's a device orientation issue.
+ Annie collides with objects. Make objects "repel" her.
+ Add sky to the environment.
+ Fix rotation for device orientation (seems stuck in the y-rotation).
+ Start to think about overall and transitions between scenes.
+ Model Annie
+ Start to think about objects in other scenes.
+ What is the other "view" when Annie blinks?
